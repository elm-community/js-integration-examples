# Internationalization - [Live Demo](https://ellie-app.com/8yYbRQ3Hzrta1)

This is a minimal example of how to use the `Intl` library with a custom element.

![Demo](demo.gif)

The important code lives in `src/Main.elm` and in `index.html` with comments!

Check out [`wolfadex/fluent-web`](https://github.com/wolfadex/fluent-web/) for a more complete approach, making [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) available through custom elements.


## Building Locally

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elm-community/js-integration-examples.git
cd js-integration-examples/internationalization

elm make src/Main.elm --output=elm.js
open index.html
```

Some terminals may not have an `open` command, in which case you should open the index.html file in your browser another way.
